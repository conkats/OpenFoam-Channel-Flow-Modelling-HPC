NOT AN ERROR for the improved model version check http://remimanceau.gforge.inria.fr/Publis/PDF/Manceau2005.pdf
NOT AN ERROR // dot product between two symmTensor is not correctly defined in OF. ??????????  GenElliptic.C
 NOT AN ERROR Wij =  skew(gradU); this gives minus omegaij of the paper since gradU=dUj/dxi ....skew(gradU)= 1/2*(dUj/dxi-dUi/dxj) bt this is for the SSG model which is not the default one .Its ok because the only place where omega is needed is  transpose and he used it 
NOT AN ERROR seems that the LRR model has the linear pressure strain parts without phiijw unlike the gibson launder model
SSG needs to be set to indicate whether to use SSG or LRR




crossTurbDiffusion is false by default:  ManceauHanjalic.C Ln 72 
Hanjalic and Launder P.67 mention that C1 which is Clrr1_ in the implementation is nowadays chosen between 1.5 and 1.8. However, in the implementation it is  1.22

sigmaK_ is 1.0 in both papers but 1.2 in the implemented model 
sigmaEps_ 1.22 2002 and 1.15 2005 paper 1.65 the implemented model
CMu       0.22          0.21            0.22
C2_       1.85          1.83            1.9
CL_       0.45          0.161           0.25          
Cg3s_     1.9           1.3             1.3
C1_       1.4           1.44            1.44
implemented model has another Cmu_

the term             +    Cg4_ * k_ * dev( twoSymm(fbij & fSij) ) doesn't give the correct corresponding part for 2/3 blm Slm delta ij because the trace of fbij & fSij is not the same as  blm Slm.. .This is for the SSG model ...CHECK
