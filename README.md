# OpenFoam-CFD modelling
## Channel-Flow-SGE-UoM-HPC
The main objective of this exercise is to gain some experience in using an open-source CFD tool, OpenFOAM v9 distributed by OpenFOAM Foundation, to running turbulent flow simulations and post-process them on the HPC Sungrid Engine of the University of Manchester, configured with sun-grid-enginee (SGE). 
OpenFoam is written in C++, a high-level object-oriented programming language. For the purposes of this tutorial, the fully turbulent channel flow of Retau=395 will be simulated as 3-D since it forms the basis of the Large Eddy Simulation tutorial provided by OpenFoam v9 and also an 1-D computation is used to compared the results with published DNS data.
